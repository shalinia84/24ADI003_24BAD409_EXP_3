Scenario 1 – Multilinear Regression

 Dataset (Kaggle – Public)
 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams
 
This project predicts student final exam scores using multilinear regression based on study hours, attendance, parental education, test preparation, and sleep hours. The data is preprocessed, categorical features are encoded, and missing values handled. The model is trained, evaluated using MSE, RMSE, and R², and optimized with Ridge/Lasso regression. Visualizations show predicted vs actual scores, feature influence, and residual distribution.

Scenario 2 – Polynomial Regression

Dataset (Kaggle – Public)https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/autompg-dataset

This project predicts vehicle MPG using polynomial regression based on engine horsepower. Polynomial features of degrees 2, 3, and 4 are created, scaled, and models trained. Evaluation uses MSE, RMSE, and R², and Ridge regression is applied to reduce overfitting. Visualizations include polynomial curves, training vs testing error, and overfitting/underfitting demonstration.
